Hi!
I've just recently started to learn python.
I've read the first part of Python Crash Course, and currently, I am studying in depth how OOP works in Python.
I wanted to learn how to use Tkinter first, but if I want a smooth code I need to learn OOP well.
The projects I am publishing are really basic, 
but please feel free to suggest me what to improve or what to learn.
